    "# S&P 500 Analysis: Normal Distributions, Confidence Intervals, and the Central Limit Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1. Objectives**\n",
    "1. **Explore** the distribution of daily returns of the S&P 500 from 2008–2023.  \n",
    "2. **Test normality** using the Shapiro-Wilk test and QQ-plot.  \n",
    "3. **Display confidence intervals** with Monte Carlo simulations.  \n",
    "4. **Illustrate the Central Limit Theorem** on annual mean returns from 1950-2023.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Methodology**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Data Parsing (fetchdata.py)**\n",
    "- **Source**: Yahoo Finance via `yfinance`.  \n",
    "- **Steps**:  \n",
    "  1. Download raw OHLCV data.  \n",
    "  2. Compute daily returns using `.pct_change()`.  \n",
    "  3. Save the processed data to a CSV file.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Descriptive Statistics of Daily Returns (graphs.py)**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Summary Statistics**\n",
    "The following statistics were computed for the daily returns of the S&P 500 from 2008 to 2023:  \n",
    "- **Mean**: 0.000380  \n",
    "- **Standard Deviation**: 0.012919  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Histogram and QQ-Plot**\n",
    "- A histogram (returns_histogram.png) of the daily returns was plotted and compared to a fitted normal distribution with the same mean and standard deviation.  \n",
    "- A Quantile-Quantile (QQ) plot (qqplot_daily.png) was generated to compare the quantiles of the daily returns to those of a standard normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Shapiro-Wilk Test**\n",
    "- The Shapiro-Wilk test was performed to assess whether the daily returns follow a normal distribution.  \n",
    "- **P-value**: `0.0000`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Interpretation**\n",
    "- The histogram shows that the daily returns of the S&P 500 are not perfectly symmetric and have more extreme values than a normal distribution.\n",
    "- The QQ-plot further highlights this deviation, particularly in the extreme tails, where the data points diverge significantly from the diagonal line.  \n",
    "- The Shapiro-Wilk test confirms this observation, with a p-value of `0.0000`. This suggests that the daily returns do not follow a normal distribution.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Confidence Intervals with Monte Carlo Simulations (confidenceintervals.py)**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Monte Carlo Process**\n",
    "- Random daily returns are generated for each path using `np.random.normal(μ, σ, days)`.  \n",
    "- Cumulative returns for each path are computed using `(1 + random_returns).cumprod()`.  \n",
    "- All paths are stored in a 2D array of shape `(days, n_simulations)`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Confidence Intervals**\n",
    "- For each day, the **2.5th percentile** (lower bound) and **97.5th percentile** (upper bound) are calculated across all simulated paths.  \n",
    "- The **median path** is also computed to represent the central tendency.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Interpretation (cumulative_returns_fan_chat.png)**\n",
    "- The confidence intervals highlight the range of potential cumulative returns over the specified time horizon:  \n",
    "  - The **width of the confidence interval** widen over time, showing increasing uncertainty.\n",
    "  - The **median path** suggests the most likely trajectory, but the wide range of possible outcomes underscores the inherent risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Central Limit Theorem on Annual Mean Returns (graphs.py)**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Summary Statistics**\n",
    "- **Mean**: 0.000353  \n",
    "- **Standard Deviation**: 0.000627  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Histogram and QQ-Plot**\n",
    "- A histogram (clt_annual_means.png) of the annual means was plotted and compared to a fitted normal distribution with the same mean and standard deviation.  \n",
    "- A Quantile-Quantile (QQ) plot (qqplot_annual.png) was generated to compare the quantiles of the daily returns to those of a standard normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Interpretation**\n",
    "- Although the Shapiro–Wilk test generates a p‑value below 0.05 (`0.0082`), indicating it is not normally distributed, it is much higher than that for daily returns—suggesting the distribution of annual means is closer to Gaussian.\n",
    "- Increasing the number of observations (e.g., years of returns) would further help reduce the impact of extremes, bringing the distribution of means closer to normal.\n",
    "\n",

    "## **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "This project provided a comprehensive analysis of the S&P 500 returns, focusing on their distribution, confidence intervals, and the Central Limit Theorem. The key findings are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Daily Returns**: The analysis of daily returns from 2008–2023 revealed that they do not follow a normal distribution. The Shapiro-Wilk test, histogram, and QQ-plot all highlighted significant deviations, particularly in the tails, indicating heavy-tailed behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Confidence Intervals**: Monte Carlo simulations demonstrated the range of potential cumulative returns over time. The widening confidence intervals underscored the increasing uncertainty in future returns, while the median path provided a central tendency for expected outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Annual Mean Returns**: By examining annual mean returns from 1950–2023, the distribution was found to be closer to normal compared to daily returns. Although the Shapiro-Wilk test still rejected normality, the higher p-value and visual assessments suggested that increasing the number of observations would further align the distribution with Gaussian behavior."
